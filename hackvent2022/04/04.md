# [HV22.04] Santas radians

On the webpage, we have multiple circles. What's interesting is the initial rotation of each circle, available in the source code.

```js
[ 2.5132741228718345, 0.4886921905584123, -1.2566370614359172, 0, 2.548180707911721, -1.9547687622336491, -0.5235987755982988, 1.9547687622336491, -0.3141592653589793, 0.6283185307179586, -0.3141592653589793, -1.8151424220741028, 1.361356816555577, 0.8377580409572781, -2.443460952792061, 2.3387411976724013, -0.41887902047863906, -0.3141592653589793, -0.5235987755982988, -0.24434609527920614, 1.8151424220741028 ];
```

First of all, we need to convert these radians into degrees.

```js
[ 144, 28, -72, 0, 146, -112, -30, 112, -18, 36, -18, -104, 78, 48, -140, 134, -24, -18, -30, -14, 104 ]
```

We notice that all of these values are even, which suggests that they have been doubled. We divide everything by 2.

```js
[ 72, 14, -36, 0, 73, -56, -15, 56, -9, 18, -9, -52, 39, 24, -70, 67, -12, -9, -15, -7, 52 ]
```

- The first value is `72`, the ASCII value of `H`, which is a good start!
- In order to get `86`, the ASCII value of `V`, we need to add 72 to 14.
- Then, to get `50`, the ASCII value of `2`, we need to add -36 to 86.

Based on these findings, we can easily calculate each character code by simply adding each value to the previous value.

```js
[72, 86, 50, 50, 123, 67, 52, 108, 99, 117, 108, 56, 95, 119, 49, 116, 104, 95, 80, 73, 125]
```

Then we just convert each value into a character to get the flag!

## Code

Here's a javascript solution that can be entered in the console:

```js
degs = rot.map(r => Math.round(r * 180 / Math.PI));
half_degs = degs.map(x => x / 2);
char_codes = half_degs.reduce((arr, x) => [...arr, x + (arr[arr.length - 1] ?? 0)], []);
flag = char_codes.map(x => String.fromCharCode(x)).join("");
```
