The python script behaves weirdly because it contains a bunch of `NUL` bytes.
- On each line, the characters following a `NUL` are ignored.
- Combined with `'''`, they are used to comment out a bunch of lines, including the `randrange` block.
- But it's not really important anyway, they are just here to make it confusing.

Since we know the encrypted flag and we know that it's a xor encryption, we can just encrypt the solution to get the flag.

```python
flag = ""
for i,c in enumerate(correct):
  flag += chr(c ^ ord(song[i*10 % len(song)]))
print(flag)
```
