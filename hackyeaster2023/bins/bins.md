# [HE2023] Bins

- The challenge tells us to find the correct **bin** to put the rubbish in.

```
  //    //                    //
 ('>   ('>    LX2gkn81        ('>
 /rr   /rr       carrots      /rr
*\))_ *\))_                  *\))_
```

- Since that page doesn't contain anything else, we probably need to find the flag somewhere else on the internet.

- `bin` could mean `pastebin`, especially since `LX2gkn81` looks exactly like a random paste ID.

- We open https://pastebin.com/LX2gkn81, enter the password `carrots`, and get the flag.
