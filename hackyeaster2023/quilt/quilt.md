# [HE2023] Quilt

- The image is a bunch of QR Codes.
- Each QR code seems to contain exactly one character.
- Using [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://demo.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/), which is able to scan all the QR codes from an image at once, we can easily read the text that was written.
- The text is quite long, but after 2 fake flags, we get the real one.
